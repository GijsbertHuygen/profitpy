Bugs and Limitations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The KDE xml ui resource file is included in the source directory.  Toolbar 
editing is broken when the file is moved to a better location, (e.g., 
~/.kde/share/apps/profitdevice/profitdevice.rc).  There isn't a workaround
for this yet.
