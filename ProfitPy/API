ProfitPy - API Documentation
==============================================================================
This document provides a brief tour of the various ways to write programs with
the ProfitPy toolkit.

This file is separated into five sections:

    Library Modules
    Library Configuration
    GUI Configuration
    GUI Scripting
    Strategy Objects

Each section builds on the previous, so even if you're only interested in 
writing custom trading strategies, you should read the entire document.


Library Modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ProiftPy includes a library of object types that model the various aspects of
a trading system.  The main types in this library are:

    AccountSupervisor - coordinates guidance with order handling
    BrokerProxy - connects to TWS and proxies its messages to other objects
    OrderSupervisor - submits, tracks, and mutates orders
    OrderPolicyHandler - filters and maps positions to order attributes
    TickerSupervisor - updates ticker objects and submits their guidance
    TechnicalTicker - coordinates data with its indexes and a trading strategy
    Session - conglomeration for each of the above

The typical order of operations for a client is this:

    1.  Client constructs a session object:

        >>> import profit.lib.session as session
        >>> my_session = session.Session()

        Refer to the "Library Configuration" section for information on 
        controlling how Session objects are constructed.

    2.  The client connects the Session object to a running instance of TWS
        and requests its data feeds:

        >>> my_session.broker.connect(('localhost', 7496))
        >>> my_session.broker.request_external()

        At this point, TWS sends data to the objects contained within the
        Session, and those objects can respond to TWS as needed.

Once the Session is connected, it will begin automated trading.  Trading is
triggered as follows:

    1.  The account supervisor collects account data, such as available funds,
        profit and loss, liquidation, etc.

    2.  The ticker supervisor accepts ticker data, routes it to the appropriate
        technical ticker object, and forwards its signals to the account 
        supervisor.

    3.  The account supervisor determines if the order can be processed.  It 
        delegates this determination to its order handler, which by default is
        an instance of policies.OrderPolicyHandler.

    4.  If the order can be processed, it's submitted by one of the policy 
        handlers.

    5.  TWS will send order status information, and the session object defers 
        these updates to its order supervisor.  The supervisor tracks the 
        order, and if necessary, cancels it or modifies it based on its total
        time to live.


profit.lib.account
------------------------------------
The account module defines the AccountSupervisor and it's supporting types.  
The purpose of an AccountSupervisor is to coordinate order requests from the
ticker supervisor with the order checking and placement machinery.

The AccountSupervisor tracks account values and controls the submission of new
orders.  The 'put_ticker_signal' method allows other objects to submit a 
guidance signal.  The ticker supervisor uses this method to suggest changes to
positions on its various tickers.

Session objects contain an AccountSupervisor named 'account'.


profit.lib.account.base
------------------------------------
The base module contains a whole bunch of stuff that gets used almost 
everywhere else in the toolkit.  It's not big, and if you're serious about
using this package, I suggest you simply read the source.


profit.lib.broker
------------------------------------
The broker module defines the BrokerProxy type.  Instances of this type handle
connecting to TWS and feeding its incoming data to some other object.

Session objects contain an BrokerProxy named 'broker'.


profit.lib.coverage
------------------------------------
The coverage module is actually a script that can be used to test a trading 
strategy against historical data.  Execute the script at a prompt to learn 
more about its use.


profit.lib.orders
------------------------------------
The orders module defines the OrderSupervisor for handling order messages.  
This type creates OrderMonitor objects for orders as it's informed of them, 
and also runs a thread to modify and cancel orders as necessary.

The behavior of the OrderMutator thread is a very good candidate for 
modification.

Session objects contain an OrderSupervisor named 'orders'.


profit.lib.policies
------------------------------------
The type OrderPolicyHandler in this module accepts or rejects order requests.
Acceptable orders are submitted to TWS.

To determine if an order is acceptable, an OrderPolicyHandler object will defer
the question to its list of policies.  Each policy in the list will be given a
chance to accept or veto an order.  If an order is not vetoed, the final policy
submits the order to TWS.


profit.lib.series
------------------------------------
The series module sequence types that 

TechnicalTicker instances create multiple Series objects for tracking various
price and size updates from TWS (such as bid price, last size, etc.).

Strategy objects add various 'index' objects to each of these primary series.  
When the primary series is updated with new data, each index is also updated 
and given a chance to 

The key concept here is that series objects are updated every time data for
the ticker comes from TWS.  After the incoming data has been sent to the 
ticker object and its indexes, the ticker supervisor type checks the ticker
for a strategy object.  If present, this strategy object is used to return a
signal.  The signal is then feed to the account supervisor for consideration.
