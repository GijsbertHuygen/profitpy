ProfitPy - Installation Instructions
==============================================================================
Sadly, there is no real installation script for the package.

Before you continue, make sure you have the dependancies satisified.  These
dependancies are listed in the ANNOUNCE file.

Once that's done, you have to make the 'profit' directory visible to your
python interpreter.  You can do that by setting an appropriate PYTHONPATH 
environment variable, or by moving the directory to someplace that is already
in the python sys.path.

I don't recommend trying to run these tools from the current directory.
