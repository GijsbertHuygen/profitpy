<h4>What is ProfitPy?</h4>
ProfitPy is a set of libraries and tools for the development, testing, and

<h4>No, really, what is it?</h4>
ProfitPy is my trading toolkit.  I use its collector tool to gather
data from IB TWS.  Using this data, I run the coverage tool to test
my trading strategies.  Once I'm happy with a strategy, it
gets executed with the main GUI program.  

<br /><br />I don't include any trading strategies that work -- 
those are for you to write.

<br /><br />
This toolkit only works with one broker, <a href="http://www.interactivebrokers.com/">Interactive Brokers</a>.  Their
<a href="http://www.interactivebrokers.com/php/tws/demo.php">TWS application</a> and <a href="http://www.interactivebrokers.com/php/webhelp/whnjs.htm">its API</a>, along with crazy-low <a href="http://www.interactivebrokers.com/php/generalAccount/commission.php">commissions and fees</a>, make
for many, many trading opportunities.
